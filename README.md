## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The following steps were taken to clean and preprocess the data:

1. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**: Columns like `Unnamed: 0`, `index`, `id`, and `Link` were dropped as they were not useful for analysis.
2. **Handling Duplicates**: Duplicate rows were identified and removed.
3. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values in columns like `Finger Print Sensor`, `MS Office Provided`, `Face Recognition`, and `Number of Cores` were filled with appropriate values.
4. **Feature Engineering**: New features were created, such as `RAM (GB)`, `SSD (GB)`, `HDD (GB)`, and `Expandable Memory (GB)`, by extracting numerical values from existing columns.
5. **Encoding Categorical Variables**: Categorical variables like `Processor Brand`, `RAM Type`, and `Storage Type` were encoded using one-hot encoding or ordinal encoding.
6. **Scaling**: Numerical features were scaled using `MaxAbsScaler` to prepare them for machine learning models.
7. **Splitting Data**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Model Building

A Linear Regression model was used to predict the price of laptops based on the cleaned and preprocessed data. The model was evaluated using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (RÂ²).
